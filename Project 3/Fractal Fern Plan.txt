Fractal Fern Plan

How to draw a fern:
	- Start with a central stalk, a thicker line segment which curves in a single direction
		- Create a branch going off from each node (where line segments connect) 
		- Each level of recursion can be slighlty thinner

Considerations/decisions:
	- Use slider for levels of recursion?
	- Add a background image? (low priority)
		- Use a space growing lab?

Project Requirements:
	- Use randomness in 3 different ways
		1. Direction of main stem?
		2. Color of fern?
		3. What side the fern starts on?
		4. Clorophyl/greeness level?
	- Sliders to control three aspects
		1. Levels of recursion
		2. Density/sparseness of branches?
		3.
